### Welcome!ðŸ‘‹

###

Hello, I'm a little guy there who likes technology and games. I'm almost finishing high school and technical course. I'm currently learning web development, the goal is to become a FullStack Dev.

I like to be creative, so I think design programming is great for me. I always have ideas that I would like to see put into practice and working, so I study as much as I can to make it happen.

Have a good day!
